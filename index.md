## Sarithra Sambavangal

Sarithra Sambavangal literally means "Historical Incidents". It is written by Vaandu Mama. It's not a contiguous story, moreso a collection of several historical stories set throughout the myriad of ages and places of India. From the valorous Maharana Pratap's fight against the Mughals, to the quest of a Pallava sculptor boy's quest to find his father. Vaandu Mama, in the foreword of this book, expresses his view that he's only been able to capture a mere water droplet, compared to the ocean of stories that India contains.

## FAQ
- **Do you have permission from the original authors/publishers to translate and publish these translations, that too under the GNU GPLv3 License?**  
  **No.** We do not have any explicit permission to publish these translations. Me and Vishard are fully willing to take down these translations fully, should the publisher/author request it. I've tried to reach out to the publishers online but couldn't find any contact details like e-mail addresses. However, seeing that multiple audiobook readings, notes, and other adaptations exist online freely without having been taken down, we have decided to publish these translations.

- **I don't know much Tamil, is there any way I can contribute?**  
  Yes, there are many things you can contribute to! Helping with the designs, adding notes, dates, grammar, etc. Just be sure to be polite and don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification.
  
- **Where can I give feedback on the site?**  
  Feel free to visit the repository and open an Issue, or start a Discussion. Note: You will require a GitHub account in order to participate and contribute. However, GitHub accounts are free to sign up for, and you can create an account using your pre-existing Microsoft account, if you have one.

The initial scope of this site is to translate just 2 books fully, but in time we hope to expand to the third ICSE Class X Book, Rajaraja Chozhan. Me and Vishard do not have a copy of this book, so if anyone does have a copy, feel free to contribute.
