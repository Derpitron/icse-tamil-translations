## [Veerapandiya Kattabomman](texts/veerapandiya-kattabomman)

Veerapandiya Kattabomman is the story of a brave Tamil King (Veerapandiya Kattabomman), written by **K. Jeevabharathi**. This story details Kattabomman's struggle of attrition against the British East India Company, set in 18th century India. we hope that by translating it, we can bring an appreciation of the early freedom fighters to you, the reader.

## [Sarithra Sambavangal](texts/sarithra-sambavangal)

Sarithra Sambavangal literally means "Historical Incidents". It is written by Vaandu Mama. It's not a contiguous story, moreso a collection of several historical stories set throughout the myriad of ages and places of India. From the valorous Maharana Pratap's fight against the Mughals, to the quest of a Pallava sculptor boy's quest to find his father. Vaandu Mama, in the foreword of this book, expresses his view that he's only been able to capture a mere water droplet, compared to the ocean of stories that India contains.

- **Do you have permission from the original authors/publishers to translate and publish these translations, that too under the CC-BY-NC License?**  
  **No.** We do not have any explicit permission to publish these translations. We are fully willing to take down these translations fully, should the publisher/author request it. I've tried to reach out to the publishers online but couldn't find any contact details like e-mail addresses. However, seeing that multiple audiobook readings, notes, and other adaptations exist online freely without having been taken down, we have decided to publish these translations, especially seeing as how this project can be considered a Transformative Work.

- **I don't know much Tamil, is there any way I can contribute?**  
  Yes, there are many things you can contribute to! Helping with the designs, adding notes, dates, English grammar, etc. Just be sure to be polite and don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification.

- **What is the meaning of some text formats? E.g bold, italic type**
  **Bold** - Headings, subheadings, or important text which should be read before the normal text.
  *Italic* - Text added by the translators themselves which is not included in the original Tamil text, e.g a commentary or inline explanation.
- **Do you use any Javascript or data analytics?**
  Yes, we use Google Analytics to track website engagement, however by design, none of the webmasters know anything else about you. If you wish to not be tracked at     all, you can use a browser addon like NoScript which blocks Javascript for selected websites.
